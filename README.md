This is a card game running without graphical interface, through a console.

The project was meant to assess the coding skills gained after two semesters of a Python course, with the emphasis on the use of custom classes.

The idea of the game itself is old and obviously wasn't my own, but the choice, to make it my final paper, was.

Documentation is unfortunately only available in Polish right now, but I'll be able to translate it to English, if necessary.
